# Purpose
This project is a based around a desire to document where my wife have been in our travels. 
We plan on going on many more trips, and it is my intent to grow this map as our travels grow.

# Growth
* Each vacation should have its own view
  * Add in [clicks](http://danielmontague.com/projects/easyButton.js/v1/examples/#clicks) for views 
  * Add a [sidebar](https://github.com/turbo87/leaflet-sidebar/)
  * Look for more [ideas](http://leafletjs.com/plugins.html#user-interface)
  
# Display
This will be shown on my [blog](https://datavistics.github.io/) when a reasonable maturity is reached,
stay tuned for the exact page!
